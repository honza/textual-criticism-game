# Textual Criticism Game

This is a pen-and-paper game for children (and adults!) to learn some of the
concepts of textual criticism.  The players will set out to recover a lost story
about a fisherman by using many different manuscripts.  The finished product
will consist of a number of pieces of paper with various fragments of the
original text.

Given my background, many of the ideas in the game will be modelled on the
ideas from the transmission of the New Testament text.

A small guide will accompany the fragments.  This will provide some information
about the document, the different types of writing styles and their dating,
when certain fonts were invented, etc.

The game will be distributed as a PDF for anyone to print off at home.
